Hi, Sam.

A question from Gilbert Saint-Flour on the IBM-MAIN list prompted
me to put together a quick program.

Gilbert wanted a program that could copy and reblock a VBS format
disk file that had a full-track block size.  Apparently, an
appropriate utility didn't exist.  The large block interface is
not currently supported for disk files.  So, I wrote a copy
program.

The program is very simple. It reads the input file a track at a
time, deblocks the records, and writes them out to a new VBS file
using QSAM.


I've included the assembler source in case you want to include
the file on the CBT tape.
