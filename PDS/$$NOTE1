Hi Sam,

The program I sent yesterday would not work with input blocks
greater than 32,767 bytes.  It incorrectly used LH to pick up the
block length from the count field and CH to compare the block
length to the RDW in the block.  This new version should handle
blocks greater than 32K in size.

(See attached file: COPYVBS.txt)

Keep up the good work!
